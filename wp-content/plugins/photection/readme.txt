With this plugin you can disable right click on your images with a custom message!

== Description ==

Photection is a plugin to help you prevent image theft by disabling right click on images on your site, without an impact on site usability (right clicks on everything else will still work!).

When an user right-clicks on your image, a small (customizable) message will appear telling him that the image is copyrighted.

Please keep in mind, that no plugin will ever make your images 100% secure.
There will always be advanced techniques to steal your images, no matter what you do or which plugin you use. Here is an article [about image protection online](https://colormelon.com/image-right-click-protection-plugin/), you can read that to learn more.

That said - there is no reason why you should make it easy to save your images, and this plugin is designed to do just that.
